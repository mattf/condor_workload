The hertz workload
------------------

Generate a workload with expected job submission, start and completion
rates

/bin/sleep is used for this workload. The expectation is no meaningful
memory, CPU or network load is generated on execute nodes.

The workload produces a set job rate and randomly distributed writes
across a set of 10,000 user log files.

Usage -
 $ condor_submit -a duration=<sleep args> \
                 -a count=<#> \
                 -a log_dir=<path to dir> \
      torture.job

The workload has an expected Hz of count / duration. With caveats,
 . submission is not zero-cost, so Hz will be less than count/duration
 . a pool with N cores cannot exceed N / duration Hz
